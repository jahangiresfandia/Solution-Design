This is a scientific space for our group to share the data.
It includes papers, videos of final design, photos of devices, presentations.

Project Description:

On summer semester of 2018, we are taking ‘Solution Design’ course presented by Dr. Ohl, at university of Otto-von-Guericke, Magdeburg. The goal of this lecture is to come up with an idea to assemble an apparatus to solve or improve a medical issue. Through this project, we have to accomplish several tasks to meet the final product.

Members of Group:

We are 3rd semester Master students of Medical Systems Engineering. the 

Idea:

Drinking spoiled milk or juices always causes a variety of medical problem especially for children. Detecting the condition of the beverage in immediately and with a portable device could be an effective resolution to this complex problem while different beverages have different characteristics and it is quite difficult to find a mutual solution.
